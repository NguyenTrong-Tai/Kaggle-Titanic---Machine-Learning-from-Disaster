# Titanic Disaster Survival Prediction

This project is part of the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict survival outcomes based on passenger information using machine learning models.

##  Objective

- Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and passenger data.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  - `sklearn` for modeling
  - `xgboost` or other models (depending on notebook)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure required packages are installed (listed in `requirements.txt` - `pip install -r requirements.txt` or install manually).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `titanic.ipynb`.
4. Active cuda and Run all cells to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Train and validate the model
   - Generate predictions for submission

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Validation Accuracy**: ~85%
- **Kaggle Submission Score**: ~76%

> Note: The drop in performance from validation to Kaggle score may indicate overfitting or differences in test data distribution.
